# **Machi Engine**
**Machi** is c++ game engine.   
this is one of my hobby project.  
it is strongly inspired by **Unreal Engine**.

# **Plan**
- first plan is making **Window** version Engine. I need to concern compatibility with other OS Apis.  
- making **Engine Editor** is second objective. 

# **Supported OS Platform**
**Windows 10**
- **DirectX12**


**MacOS**(will support soon)
- **Metal**


# **Version**
current branch :  dev.1

## **branch naming**
- **master** : Program operation is ___guaranteed___.
- **dev**__.x__ :  temporary development branch. Program operation is ___not guaranteed___.




# **dependency**
```
cmake
directx12(windows only)
```
